## Install Instructions
1. Fork and Clone this repo, *supra-sched*, and our server repo, *supra-sched-bend*
  - Note: These repos will be combined with a 'concurrently' command soon -- stay tuned
2. `npm install` at the root of each directory
3. `npm start` at root of *supra-sched* to start react app on localhost 3000
4. `npm start` at root of *supra-sched-bend* to start server on localhost 3002
5.  In *supra-sched-bend* pull postgres from docker:
  -  `docker exec -it <container-ID> bash`
  -  `psql -U postgres`
6. Create a database called `supra-sched-db`
  - `CREATE DATABASE supra-sched-db;`
7. Spin up knex in *supra-sched-bend*
  - `npx knex migrate:latest` will add a table to your DB
  - `npx knex seed:run` will fill it with some initial values
8. You can add events and tasks to your library. Specify a availability to block that time from being used for future events.
  - NOTE: OCCASIONALLY takes several submits to get the FIRST event to display on the home page.
9. On the home page, you can see all scheduled events.

### Test Install
1. In *supra-sched-bend* create a database called `supra-sched-db_test`
  - `CREATE DATABASE supra-sched-db_test;`
2. `npm test` at root of *supra-sched-bend*
3. In *supra-sched* `npm test` at root.
